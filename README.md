IRC-Eggdrop-TCL
===============

TCL scripts for use with Eggdrop IRC bots.

Developed originally on Eggdrop 1.6.x, but should work with 1.9.x if compat module is loaded. I like sqlite3, so data storage for these scripts uses it. 

- lilyurl (URL2IRC): Scans links in IRC channels and returns titles and tinyurl, and logs to a webpage. 
  *MASSIVE UPDATES in 1.7!* Please report any links that do not get titled or logged correctly. 

- lilykarma: A Karma database script for Eggdrop bots. It has flood control built in, and basic self-karma prevention. 

- lilydecide: A very basic 'this or that' script. 

- autobar: A robot bartender for all your virtual drinking needs. 

- cmotion2022: A rework of the BMotion bot, has been converted to use sqlite3 database instead of on disk files, plus lots of other cleanups. 

- lilyweather: A weather report scraper. Uses wunderground for data (has not been updated in some time and is probably broken, sorry)
