## TODO
Randomly use handle (in bot userlist) instead of nick. 
Random output - check for time of day field (modules)
Select recent random person to address (modules)
Validate plugins on load

-- New Plugins --
- movie quote plugins - quote from the list returns a different quote. 
- song lyrics - same as above. 
- shower = gets towel/cam/in too
= facts system - having the bot remember random facts could be interesting as random output. 
==  fallthrough for default questions  


# RECHECK
Need to set cMotionLastEvent to nonnull - 
Tcl error in script for 'timer66417':
can't read "cMotionLastEvent(#silentchan)": no such element in array 


--DATABASE CONVERSION--
  abstracts.tcl - 
      batchadd to sqliteDB (rework abstracts.tcl): 
      --if {![table in db]} {create} else { if {list length != tablelength} {drop/recreate} }
      this fails with xtra fields in db (last used), so do: 
      in batchadd; load abstract into arrays from textfile and db and compare 
      matched lines go back to db, then add new and delete missing from text array 

       + reload/drop command in mgmt plugin

      random output sorted by last used date, then random from oldest 10. 
      random says also pulled from entire abstracts DB ? use/dontuse flag on batchadd?
      nicks need to be tracked for friendship [cMotionIsFriend (cMotionGetAltName)]?
